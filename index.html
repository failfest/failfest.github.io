        <p class="lead">Failure is a crucial part of the scientific process, but it is rarely given the same respect as success. <br/>
        FailFest, a half day workshop at IEEE VIS 2020, is a chance for the visualization community to share<br>
        personal research failures and celebrate the important knowledge gained through these experiences.</p>
        <h4>The workshop will cumulate strategies for building a VIS community<br>
        that acknowledges failure and embraces its scientific value.</h4>

              <em>Sunwoo Ha, Adam Kern, Melanie Bancilhon, Alvitta Ottley</em><br>
              <b>Abstract</b> Our research aimed to present the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative system that aids the user in handling complex datasets and dense visualization systems. We attempted to demonstrate this system with two trials of an online between-groups, two-by-two study, measuring the effects of this mixed-initiative system on user interactions and system usability. However, due to flaws in the interface design and the expectations that we put on users, we were unable to show that the adaptive system had an impact on user interactions or system usability. In this paper, we discuss the unexpected findings that we found from our "failed" experiments and examine how we can learn from our failures to improve further research.

              <b>Abstract</b> We conducted a questionnaire study aimed towards PhD students in the field of visualization research to understand how they cope with paper rejections. We collected responses from 24 participants and performed a qualitative analysis of the data in relation to the provided support by collaborators, resubmission strategies, handling multiple rejects, and personal impression of the reviews. The results indicate that the PhD students in the visualization community generally cope well with the negative reviews and, with experience, learn how to act accordingly to improve and resubmit their work. Our results reveal the main coping strategies that can be applied for constructively handling rejected visualization papers. The most prominent strategies include: discussing reviews with collaborators and making a resubmission plan, doing a major revision to improve the work, shortening the work, and seeing rejection as a positive learning experience.
